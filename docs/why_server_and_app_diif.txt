âœ… Purpose of Each File
File	Purpose
app.ts	Sets up the Express app â€” routes, middleware, etc. No server starts here.
server.ts	Only starts the server (app.listen) using the app from app.ts.

ðŸ”§ Why Split Them?
1. Separation of Concerns
app.ts: Pure Express logic (routing, middleware).

server.ts: Deployment-related stuff (port, env, listening).

2. Testing-Friendly
You can import app.ts directly into a test file without starting the server.
